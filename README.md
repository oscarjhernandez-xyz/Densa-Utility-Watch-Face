# Densa Utility Watch Face
Watch face inspired by Google's Utility watch face with a focus on compacting information and complications

The overall goal of this watch face is to provide a sleek "OLED" look while giving the user access to utilize as much or as little of the screen as possible when customizing complications. As this is meant to build upon the design Google's Utility watch face, some improvements include the ability to display seconds and bumping the number up from 4 possible complications to 11.

## Differences
It is not meant to be possible to create a 1:1 copy of the original Google Utility watch face, especially as the original uses the proprietary Google Sans font. In its place, an open-source [Kumbh Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kumbh+Sans) is used to provide a very similar look. Beyond this, anything else is entirely open to feedback and constructive criticism.

## Building
This watch face was created through Samsung's [Watch Face Studio](https://developer.samsung.com/watch-face-studio/overview.html), so a Wear OS device targetting API level 28 or higher is required to install (will likely be higher than 28 depending on the version you download).
